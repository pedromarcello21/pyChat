def wellfound_msg(company, name):
    return f"""To the Hiring Manager,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Pedro Vincenty, a multi-disciplined problem solver with a strong programming background. I recently completed Flatironâ€™s Software Engineering program, which has equipped me with full stack development skills. Prior to that, my experience as a Data Engineer gave me valuable exposure to collaborating with cross-functional teams and contributing effectively from a technical standpoint.  My MBA from Fordham University provided me a tremendous experience to connect with like-minded professionals and hone both my technical and intrapersonal skills.

I have a demonstrated ability to simplify complex technical concepts for diverse audiences, enhancing both communication and project outcomes. I'd love the opportunity to connect and discuss how my skills could support your team at {company}.

Best,
Pedro"""
